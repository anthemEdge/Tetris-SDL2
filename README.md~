# Tetris SDL2
A minimalist remake of the classic game Tetris using SDL2.

------------------------------------------

## [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Gxpx3hvdxY0)

## Synopsis
I absolutely love the game Tetris and it's challenging nature. There are many remakes out there today but most lack certain features and none is perfect in my book. The aim of this project is to create a fast-paced, responsive, challenging Tetris game and pushes the player while providing useful tools to do so. 

## Features 
+ Progressive, non-linear gravity.
+ Progressive, non-linear lock delay.
+ Ghost piece.
+ Block holding.
+ Block preview. 
+ Hard drop and soft drop. 
+ Wall-kick and floor kick. 


## Requirements
SDL2 and SDL2_TTF libraries are required. 

## Installation

Makefile will soon be added.


## Instructions
+ [S] to start a new game, [Q] to quit at any time. 
+ [LEFT], [DOWN] and [RIGHT] arrow keys to move the current tetromino.
+ [UP] to soft drop, [SPACE] to hard drop.
+ [Z] to rotatio anti-clockwise, [X] to rotate clockwise. 
+ [C] to hold/swap.
